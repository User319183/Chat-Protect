Configuring the extension
========
Chat Protect has so much to make it flexible. Let's go through the configure command!

Bypassing
========
There are three options you have for bypassing. One is bypassing a user, this allows (a) specified user(s) to be bypassed from being censored by Chat Protect.
Two is bypassing a role, this allows a user, or users, to be bypassed in certin roles. This is better if you want a team of staff to not be censored when
messaging in chat. Three is bypassing a channel. This can be useful if you want members to be able to say anything they want in whatever channel is bypassed.
This is good for debates, arguments, or whatever your usecase may be.
